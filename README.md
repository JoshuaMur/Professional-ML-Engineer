# Professional-ML-Engineer
This repo is the track record of my Professional Machine Learning Engineer, learning experience. I will push my track records as I go through the course for documentation and everything along that line, like coming back here in the future for example.


## The Description: Intro
First of, this description is probably the main push for me to go through the course, it's just so compelling and explicit. Kind like gives you the entire view of how the course is going to impact your career, here is how it goes:
> A Professional Machine Learning Engineer builds, evaluates, productionizes, and optimizes ML models by using Google Cloud technologies and knowledge of proven models and techniques.

Well, just breaking down from there already, A Professional Machine Learning Engineer `Builds`, `Evaluates`, and `Productionizes` ML Models is like the super powers of a Machine Learning Engineer aleready in the first line of the description, and then it goes on and say -- and `Optimizes` ML models. And yeah those are literally the activities an ML Engineer is paid for in most cases. Optimizing ML models is probably is probably the primary task for an ML Engineer, as this gives the ability to work with already super perfomant Models and adapt them or "Optimize them" to perform best with their particular dataset, and just to say the least, that is a f*ing super ability in today's fast disrapting ML scene, in a sense that, relying on your own models and not being able to optimize existing ones, can be a litte or too much cost and time (pretty much the same) consuming, and can make the team's perfomance falling behind.

The descriptionf also continues by saying:
> The ML Engineer handles large, complex datasets and creates repeatable, reusable code.

And what can I say, that is like the most descriptive sentece to explain the pain an ML Engineer will have to face on a regular basis, 
Yeah, `Handles large, complex datasets` ðŸ’€ If that does not scare you already, you need to picture that as the most stressful activity that your entire work is going to rely on, means that you do not have any other choice than to still do it and do right. So, the fact that the course description already included that made me somehow beleive in the content that it has to offer. Cause preparation is the key and as much as handling large and complex datasets can be stressful, it is not near stressful as trying to handle that without a decent preparation, trust me, I've been their, all in the name of faking it till I make it... And it was f*cking depressing, one of the most depressing experience I had to go through. To bring back the quote "data data data i can't make bricks without clay" - Shrelock Holmes, just to emphasise how being able to handle large and complex datasets comfortably is a prime super power for a Machine Learning Engineer, because, well, without a good quality datasets, you can't really build a good quality model, which means the first attributes from up there of `Build`, `Evaluate` and `Productionize` become useless without the ability of `Handling large, comple datasets`.

> The ML Engineer considers responsible AI and fairness throughout the ML model development process, and collaborates closely with other job roles to ensure long-term success of ML-based applications.

Considering that one of my startups (which I will get to talk about in the near future) is primarly focusing on enforcing inclusion and AI systems development fairness, that part of the description literally hooked me again more to go for it and see what the other side of the world is handling the issue of fairness when it comes to ML Models, slash AI Systems.

> The ML Engineer has strong programming skills and experience with data platforms and distributed data processing tools.

Indeed, just to say the least, nothing makes ML Engineering an exciting career than the strong programming part of it, it's with no question that almost all activities conducted by an ML Engineer are code-based, and requires advanced understanding level of programming and software engineering concepts.

> The ML Engineer is proficient in the areas of model architecture, data and ML pipeline creation, and metrics interpretation. The ML Engineer is familiar with the foundational concepts of MLOps, application development, infrastructure management, data engineering, and data governance.

Keeping us in the same point raised, an ML Engineer "Must" have an advanced understanding of `Software Engineering Concepts` in their toolbox, as for me, Machine Learning Engineering is simply the Modern Day Software Engineering. So acing the base concepts of building and shipping software applications is mandatory for a complete Machine Learning Engineer Status on top of the particular understanding of Machine Learning Fundamantals.

> The ML Engineer makes ML accessible and enables teams across the organization. By training, retraining, deploying, scheduling, monitoring, and improving models, the ML Engineer designs and creates scalable, performant solutions.

And of course the ability to work and serve others, Leadership, in a sense that the Models and Systems built are built for others to access and use them otherwise, why bother building that in the first place then? So having always in mind the users of the ML Models can make the job more enjoying to do.
